You can test your UNIX skills with a quiz here . If you don\u2019t have experience with UNIX command line, or if you\u2019re unsure whether you meet the prerequisites, follow our online UNIX tutorial . Software We will be mainly working on an Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) Elastic Cloud (EC2) server. Our Ubuntu server behaves like a \u2018normal\u2019 remote server, and can be approached through ssh with a username, key and IP address. All participants will be granted access to a personal home directory. Before the course, make sure you can comfortably work on a remote server. This means that you can approach it through the shell, modify scripts and transfer files. We can recommend atom for Linux and Mac, and Notepad ++ in combination with MobaXterm for Windows. We will be visualising our results with IGV. Therefore, install in your computer: mac OS/Linux SSH and scripting: Atom with packages like: terminus and ftp-remote-edit Transferring files: FileZilla Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) Windows SSH and scripting: MobaXterm and/or Notepad++ with the plugin NppFTP Transferring files: FileZilla Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)","title":"Precourse preparations"},{"location":"precourse/#unix","text":"As is stated in the course prerequisites at the announcement web page , we expect participants to have a basic understanding of working with the command line on UNIX-based systems.
